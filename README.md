Our SAR Tax Calculator is designed to address a critical challenge faced by cryptocurrency traders—accurately calculating tax liabilities. With the surge in cryptocurrency trading, keeping track of transactions, capital gains, and tax obligations has become complex. This web app streamlines the process with intuitive tools for data entry, analysis, and visualization, making it user-friendly even for beginners.
It’s a comprehensive solution that helps traders not only calculate their taxes but also visualize their financial trends. Users can either manually enter their transactions or upload bulk data from CSV/XLSX files. The app then computes tax liabilities based on capital gains or losses.
